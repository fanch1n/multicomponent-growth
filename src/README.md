Scripts for the preprint:

## Dynamical mean-field model
- to predict the dynamical phase diagram
- to brute-force solve for the bifurcation diagram
## Lattice model with directional interactions

## Simulations
- for running the kinetic Monte Carlo(kMC) growth simulations
- for running the kMC direction coexistence simulations
